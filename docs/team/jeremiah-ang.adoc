== Summary of contributions

//* v1.1
//** Added User Stories to Developer Guide
//** Created initial Mock up of UI
//
//* v1.2
//
//** Model
//*** Calculation of `CAP` based on given set of `Modules`
//*** Calculation of `Target Grades` based on given set of `Complete/Incomplete modules`
//*** Implement different `States` of a `Grade`
//
//** Logic
//*** Implement the classes to handle command to set `CAP Goal`
//** Documentation
//*** Updated User Guide on `CAP Goal` command
//
//* v1.3
//** Model
//*** Implement triggers to calculate `Target Grades` and `Current CAP`
//*** Implement `adjusting` of target grades of incomplete modules
//
//** Logic
//*** Provided interface from Logic to UI for getting
//    1. Current CAP
//    2. CAP Goal
//    3. Completed Modules
//    4. Incomplete Modules
//*** Implement the classes to handle `adjust` command
//
//** UI
//*** Provide the two `ModuleListPanel` with the correct ObservableList
//
//** Storage
//*** Update Transcript/Grade/Module's Serialiser and Deserialiser to match the correct fields.
//
//** Documentation
//*** Updated Use Cases to follow Proper format
//*** Updated User Guide on `CAP Goal` command
//*** Added Sequence Diagrams for Target Grade and CAP Calculations
//*** Update Model Component of Developer Guide


* *Major enhancement*: Added the *Target Grade Calculation* feature.

** What it does: Shows user what grades he/she needs to achieve
for those incomplete modules so as to achieve his/her CAP goal.

** Justification: This is one of the main Use Case of the application,
to allow users to quickly verify if attaining their CAP goal is still feasible or
whether withdrawing from NUS would be a wiser choice.

** Highlights:
*** Correctness/Limitations of the algorithm are carefully thought of.
It may not provide the optimal solution, but it may very well be sufficient for students
to have a general sense of the feasibility of attaining their CAP goal.
*** Calculation of target grades are triggered when changes are made to the list of modules
in the transcript and updated on the UI.
*** Users may further adjust the target grade and obtain a updated list of target grades


* *Minor enhancement*: Added the *Current CAP Calculation* feature.
