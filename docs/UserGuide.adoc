== Introduction

CAPTracker is for students who wants to use a desktop app for calculating and managing their CAP
(Cumulative Average Point). More importantly CAPTracker is *optimized for those who prefer to work
with a CLI (Command Line Interface)* while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface
(GUI). If you can type fast, CAPTracker is the ideal application for calculating your current CAP,
and predicting grades needed to achieve your ideal CAP in modules that hasn't been taken.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `10` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `captracker.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].

e.g. Typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some commands you can try:

* **`c_add`**`CS2103 2 1 4 A+` : Adds a module `CS2103` worth `4` MCs taken in Semester `1` as a
Year `2` student.
* **`c_delete`**`CS2103` : Deletes `CS2103` from CAPTracker.
* *`exit`* : Exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be replaced and supplied by the user. +
e.g. `c_add MODULE_CODE YEAR SEMESTER CREDIT [GRADE]`: +
`c_add CS2103 2 1 4 A+`.
* Items in square brackets are optional. +
e.g. `c_add MODULE_CODE YEAR SEMESTER CREDIT [GRADE]`: +
`c_add CS2103 2 1 4 A+` or +
`c_add CS2103 2 1 4`
====

=== Viewing help : `help`

Format: `help`

=== Adding a module: `c_add`

Adds a module to CapTracker +
Case 1: Module hasn't been taken yet +
Format: `c_add MODULE_CODE YEAR SEMESTER CREDIT` +
Case 2: Module already taken +
Format: `c_add MODULE_CODE YEAR SEMESTER CREDIT GRADE`

[TIP]
A module with grade provided means it has already been completed while a module without grade means
it hasn't been taken by the user.

Examples:

* `c_add CS2103 2 1 A+`
* `c_add CS2103 2 1`

****
* Adding of a module that would lead to two modules sharing the same `Code`, `Year`, and `Semester`
is not allowed.
****

=== Editing a module : `c_edit`

Edits fields of a particular module entry in the CAPTracker. +
Case 1: Only one module entry have the specified module code. +
Format: `c_edit MODULE_CODE [-code MODULE_CODE] [-year YEAR] [-semester SEMESTER] [-credit CREDIT] [-grade GRADE]` +
Case 2: Multiple module entry have the specified module code. (Retook the module) +
Format: `c_edit MODULE_CODE YEAR SEMESTER [-code MODULE_CODE] [-year YEAR] [-semester SEMESTER] [-credit CREDIT] [-grade GRADE]`

****
* Targeted module entry have to exist in the CAPTracker before editing it.
* `Year` and `Semester` of the targeted entry must be specified if there exist multiple entries with
the same module `Code`.
* At least one of the module's field has to be edited.
* The edit cannot lead to two modules sharing the same module `Code`, `Year`, and `Semester`.
****

Examples:

* `c_edit CS2103 -grade A+` +
Change grade of CS2103 to A+.
* `c_edit CS2103 -code CS2103T -credit 2` +
Change the module code and credit of CS2103 to CS2103T and 2 respecitively.
* `c_edit CS2103 3 2 -semester 1` +
Change the semester of CS2103 taken in year 3 semester 2 to 1. In this case, CS2103 was retaken and
cap tracker has multiple entries of it.


=== Deleting a module : `c_delete`

Deletes a module from the cap tracker. +
Format:

* Only one module entry with the module code exist: `c_delete MODULE_CODE`
* Multiple module entries with the same module code exist: `c_delete MODULE_CODE YEAR SEMESTER`

****
* Targeted module entry have to exist in the CAPTracker before deleting it.
* `Year` and `Semester` of the targeted entry must be specified if there exist multiple entries with
  the same module `Code`.
****

Examples:

* `c_delete CS2103` +
Delete CS2103 from the cap tracker.
* `c_delete CS2103 1 2` +
Delete CS2103 taken during the second semester of the first year.
